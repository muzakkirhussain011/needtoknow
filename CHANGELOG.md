# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). From 1.0 on, the public API is stable.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `PermissionedRetriever` with `prefilter`, `postfilter` and `auto` strategies, sync
  (`retrieve`) and async (`aretrieve`) entry points sharing one implementation.
- Failing closed: any authorizer error, wrong number of decisions or non-boolean decision raises
  `AuthorizationError` and returns nothing.
- Re-check of pre-filtered results, with `RetrievalResult.violations` counting hits that a
  backend returned despite the filter.
- A backend-neutral filter language (`In`, `And`, `Or`) with reference semantics in `matches`;
  empty `And`/`Or` are rejected because an empty conjunction would mean "allow everything".
- `MetadataACLAuthorizer` (permissions stored on each chunk) and `FunctionAuthorizer` (your own
  logic).
- `InMemoryBackend` with deterministic keyword scoring, for tests and small corpora.
- Property-based tests (Hypothesis) for the security guarantees on Python 3.10 to 3.13.
- Contributor documentation: CONTRIBUTING, GOVERNANCE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY.
- `needtoknow.backends.pgvector`: PostgreSQL + pgvector backend with the permission filter in the
  query as JSON containment tests (GIN-indexable), iterative HNSW scans, `create_schema`, and a
  native async search when given an async pool. Extra: `needtoknow[pgvector]`.
- `needtoknow.backends.chroma`: Chroma backend translating filters into `where` clauses. It never
  stores Chroma array metadata: in chromadb 1.5.x (local mode) a deleted collection's array
  metadata surfaces on new records in other collections and is used by `where` filters
  (chroma-core/chroma#7594). List values become
  one boolean field each, and search results are rebuilt from an exact JSON copy of the metadata,
  so the re-check always sees the true permissions. Extra: `needtoknow[chroma]`.
- `needtoknow.authorizers.opa`: Open Policy Agent authorizer using only the standard library, with
  per-chunk decisions and optional policy-provided filters; every failure fails closed. Example
  policy in `examples/opa`.
- `filter_to_dict` / `filter_from_dict` for a JSON form of filters.
- Conformance tests: every backend must return exactly the documents the reference semantics
  select, for random metadata and nested filters, and never leak through the retriever. CI runs
  them against real PostgreSQL, Chroma and OPA.

### Changed

- Filter values must be strings or integers, and metadata values of other types (booleans,
  floats) never match. This keeps every backend's answer identical to the reference.
- The project is now `needtoknow`, a permission-aware retrieval library (ADR 0005). The earlier
  Rampart gateway lives on as an example deployment in `examples/gateway`.
