# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). From 1.0 on, the public API is stable.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `PermissionedRetriever` with `prefilter`, `postfilter` and `auto` strategies, sync
  (`retrieve`) and async (`aretrieve`) entry points sharing one implementation.
- Failing closed: any authorizer error, wrong number of decisions or non-boolean decision raises
  `AuthorizationError` and returns nothing.
- Re-check of pre-filtered results, with `RetrievalResult.violations` counting hits that a
  backend returned despite the filter.
- A backend-neutral filter language (`In`, `And`, `Or`) with reference semantics in `matches`;
  empty `And`/`Or` are rejected because an empty conjunction would mean "allow everything".
- `MetadataACLAuthorizer` (permissions stored on each chunk) and `FunctionAuthorizer` (your own
  logic).
- `InMemoryBackend` with deterministic keyword scoring, for tests and small corpora.
- Property-based tests (Hypothesis) for the security guarantees on Python 3.10 to 3.13.
- Contributor documentation: CONTRIBUTING, GOVERNANCE, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY.

### Changed

- The project is now `needtoknow`, a permission-aware retrieval library (ADR 0005). The earlier
  Rampart gateway lives on as an example deployment in `examples/gateway`.
